# spam_detector
The Spam Classification with Random Forest Project builds a machine learning model to detect spam messages using a Random Forest classifier. It uses NLP techniques to process and extract features from text data, enabling accurate classification of messages as spam or non-spam (ham), thereby enhancing user experience on messaging platforms.
